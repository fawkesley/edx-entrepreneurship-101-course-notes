## Lamborghini Story Solution

Erdin is starting a Lamborghini garage - he has identified there are lots of Lambo owners, he chooses a good location, buys a Â£25K coffee machine and swanky interior, and opens his shop. On the first day no-one arrives and the two mechanics are twiddling their thumbs, when Laura turns up. She's got a 4 year old Volvo and she asks if he can service her car. Erdin is conscious of his expensive overheads and thinks about what to say.

"If you were Erdin, would you take Laura's business?"

I said "Yes".

Wrong! You need to build a business from the customer backwards.

Good companies build *personas* which characterise theirideal customer.

People in this target group talk together, think similarly, etc. You want to find a *single* homogenous group and serve them brilliantly.

Do one thing, do it well. Don't be a mermaid (neither a woman or a fish!)

If you want a business, you need a paying customer. BUT not just any - you need a group of paying customers who are similar in nature. Deselect other groups, else you end up with a mediocre company. Then we'll go viral - "Giovanni" (Erdin's model customer) will sell our company for us!

Don't be driven by the individual transaction.

Beware of the "market X is this big, we'll grab Y%". Then you don't know anything about your customer.

We're going to focus on a single customer, or group of customers, then build backwards to make the company. And defocus on everyone else.

We don't start with the persona - we build up to that. Step 1 is market segmentation.

## What is market segmentation?

Systematic analysis of potential customer groups.

Description of multiple, homogenous, distinct groups of target customers.

Helps you to figure out who your ideal persona is.


## How do you do it?

Start with industry, then work down into market, then market segment, then end users.

Focus first on end **users**, not customers.

When you are down to ~6 potential end users, stop and go and do some primary research.

Be fearless - go and talk to people!

Come up with some idea that you can use to talk to people.

We are looking for similar people with a similar problem and a similar solution.

Breaking down into very specific product type:

```
Online Retail | Apparel | Casual       | Preppy  | $$$$
                        | Professional | Urban   |
                        | Sports       | Modern  |
                                       | Classic | $
```

Now ask the following questions of several small market segments:

1. Who is the *end user*?
   ie Male, early 30s, doesn't care about fashion, decent job, not a lot of time : JOSH

2. What's the application?

3. Benefit - why would Josh use this business?

4. Lead Customer - influential

5. Market characteristics - ie driven by fashion

6. Market size of this segment

7. Competition - is anyone else fulfilling Josh's need?

8. Partners

9. Complementary assets (ie a computer, a credit card)

Now we have a very specific persona, we will go and find people like Josh. It's OK if we were wrong about Josh - we can find out quickly and move on.

## Case study: FINsix

New technology: smaller power supply.

Learned that mobile phones was sewn up already, lots of competition.

Thought about doing laptops or LED lighting as first market.

Discovered that LED market was so new lots was changing. Power electronics was a big bottleneck.

Turned off LED lightbulb industry because public perception was that they should be very cheap. Felt that it wasn't a good first market - not enough value to be gained.

"Making the laptop power brick small" was the best first-market.

Quote: "Finding people to talk to in order to validate your ideas early is vital"

Just a couple of good, short, customer conversations give you a stronger foundation to talk to the next ones. 

## Wrap up

Go and interview at least 10 prospective customers!
